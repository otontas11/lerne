                Regarding to the information security, we only use internet web to screenshot the advertisement image.
                Therefore, it should be not bother user data privacy.

                correct country. We do not share the information to anyone, but Admob as our partner. For further

                chosen the advertisement that appropriate for kids since they are our target market. However, we are not
                able to control all of advertisements because Admob has more control to select the content of the
                advertisement.
                <br><br />
                We are trying so hard to keep the advertisement safe for the kids. The purpose of the advertisement
                itself is not to distract the user; however it is the responsibility for the user who uses the free
                application or game.
